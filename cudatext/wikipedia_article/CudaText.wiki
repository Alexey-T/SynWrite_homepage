'''CudaText''', from [[Serbo-Croatian|Bosnian-Croatian-Montenegrin-Serbian]] ''čuda'' (“wonders” or “miracles”, [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: [ʧuda]), is a [[Free software|free open source]] cross-platform native [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] text and source code editor.

== The Core Program ==
The core program (i.e. without [[Plug-in_(computing)|plug-in]]s) is written in [[Object Pascal]] on the [[Lazarus (IDE)|Lazarus IDE]], which results in low resource requirements and the availability of native builds for [[FreeBSD]], [[Linux]], [[macOS]] and [[Windows]]. The settings are stored in [[JSON]]-files, including one file for the standard settings and another one for user-altered settings, that override the values from the standard settings file.

== Plug-in System and Python ==
CudaText has a similar plug-in system like [[Sublime Text]] or [[Atom (text editor)|Atom]]. It is based on [[Python (programming language)|Python]] (version 3.6 as of July 2018). In order to make use of the plug-ins, Python has to be installed. The macOS-build doesn't include it, so it has to be downladed and installed separately. On macOS the package including the 32-bit version is required. Also CudaText's ''Check for updates'' function requires Python.
