<b>ATImageMap</b> is a component designed to show
many images (parts of the whole image) as a single map.
For example, you may have array of images,
200 by X, and 100 by Y - control will show them as a single map.
Features:

<ul>
<li> Images are loaded from disk only when needed, depending on current position and scale
<li> Items can be added on the whole map: lines, points, circles etc
<li> Scaling of images
<li> Resampling on scaling
<li> Mouse zooming and dragging
</ul>

Component also allows to draw paths: each path consists of
many lines, points, and icons. It can be, for example, path
of a vehicle driving on a map.
Component can be developed further, for your needs.
