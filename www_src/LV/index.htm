<p>
The note about "Follow tail" mode:
it can be changed on per-tab basis. So you can enable "Follow tail" for
one file, and disable it for another.
This also can be said about the "Wrap" option.

<p>
The file highlighting feature currently supports 20 different colors.
Lines can be matched using RegEx, so you can use one color option
for seleral different words: you should specify "word1|word2|..." for this.
